 (t "The Last Name in Airfoil Analysis")
 (item "https://github.com/SlowThought/SlowFlight is ZFoil's home.")
 (item "ZFoil is an open source project.")
 (item "ZFoil uses an original method to calculate the inviscid flow about an airfoil,"
       "and to generate lift and pitch coefficients.")
 (item "Traditional boundary layer methods are used to generate drag coefficients.")
 (item "As the repository name may suggest to you, ZFoil is limited to incompressible flow."))
